## Bundle a CLI builder into a subcommand.
##
## Subcommands use the same CLI builder that top-level CLIs do,
## so they are composed using the same tools. The difference lies in
## how subcommands are prepared for usage by parents. In addition to
## providing a `name` and a `description`, you also provide a `mapper`,
## which is a function that converts the subcommand's data into a common
## type that all subcommands under a parent command need to share. This
## is required since the parent command will have a field (added with
## the [field] function) that must have a unified type.
##
## ```roc
## fooSubcommand =
##     { Cli.weave <-
##         foo: Opt.str { short: "f" },
##         bar: Opt.str { short: "b" },
##     }
##     |> SubCmd.finish { name: "foobar", description: "Foo and bar subcommand", mapper: FooBar }
## ```
finish : CliBuilder state fromAction toAction, { name : Str, description ? Str, mapper : state -> commonState } -> { name : Str, parser : ArgParser commonState, config : SubcommandConfig }
finish = \builder, { name, description ? "", mapper } ->

## Use previously defined subcommands as data in a parent CLI builder.
##
## Once all options have been parsed, we then check the first parameter
## passed to see if it's one of the provided subcommands. If so, we parse
## the remaining arguments as that subcommand's data, and otherwise continue
## parsing the current command.
##
## The [optional] function can only be used after all  `Opt` fields have been
## registered (if any) as we don't want to parse options for a subcommand
## instead of a parent, and cannot be used after any parameters have been
## registered. This is enforced using the type state pattern, where we encode
## the state of the program into its types. If you're curious, check the
## internal `Builder` module to see how this works using the `action` type
## variable.
